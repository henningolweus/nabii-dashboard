# NABII Interactive Charts - Final Delivery Notes

## ✅ Project Complete!

Your interactive dashboard for visualizing Zambia's Impact Investment Ecosystem is ready to use!

---

## 📊 Data Summary

- **Total Records in Excel:** 128 deals
- **Complete Deals (with all required fields):** 126 deals
- **Deals with Disclosed Amounts:** 85 deals
- **Anonymized Deals (filtered from individual display):** 10 deals
- **Total Investment Tracked:** $1,509.38 Million USD
- **Average Deal Size:** $11.98 Million USD (based on disclosed amounts)
- **Time Period:** 2021-2025

### Why 126 instead of 128?
- 2 records in the Excel file have missing `Deal1_Name` fields
- These incomplete records are automatically excluded from visualizations
- This is correct behavior - all valid deals are included
